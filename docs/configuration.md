# Configuration

Some parts of WorldEdit can be changed by editing a configuration file that's bundled with the addon. The location of this file depends on the platform the addon is running on, but the path relative to the `com.mojang` folder is `minecraftWorlds/(world folder)/behavior_packs/WorldEditB/scripts/config.js`.

!!! Warning

    Any changes to this file will not stay when you update the addon. You must copy this file and put it back after updating to keep your settings.

**Windows**

``` txt
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\(path to config)
```

**Android**

``` txt
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/(path to config)
```
It's recommended that you use [CX File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cxinventor.file.explorer) to access this path. You must also have Minecraft's storage mode set to External.

**iOS**

``` txt
Minecraft/games/com.mojang/(path to config)
